        I am excited to learn more about web based programming languages.<br> I have a bit of experience with html, javascript, and Django under my belt but as programming has taught me there is always more to learn than I can ever have imagined.<br></br>Web development has always interested me, especially since it is what connects the world today.<br>I would love to learn more about it in order to become a better programmer, and ultimately use those skills to help make the lives of others easier in today's modern world of technology.
