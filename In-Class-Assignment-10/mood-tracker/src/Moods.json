He loves to have his head and his chin scratched, but also loves his personal space, much like myself. He's been a wonderful addition to the family and I love him to death, even when he get's a little hangry (hungry-angry) from time to time. "

It's a slower paced show than Breaking Bad but expands on the universe the show is set in. Overall it's been a fun new show and I look forward to watching the rest of it."

However, now that I have finished the game, I no longer get to enjoy it like I was able to for the first time."
